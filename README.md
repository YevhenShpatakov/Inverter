# ‚ö° Inverter Project with LCL Filtering

This project aimed to design an inverter system with adjustable output frequency by changing the values of the LCL filter components. The system was developed with a focus on component flexibility and optimized PCB layout.

## üìê Technical Description

- The **LCL filter** was initially designed to output a frequency of **50 Hz**.
- The inverter is controlled via **PWM signal** generated by an **ESP32 microcontroller**.
- The power stage is built around an **H-bridge** using **N-channel MOSFETs (STP40NF10L)**.
- **IR2104 MOSFET drivers** were used for isolation and gate control.

## üñ•Ô∏è PCB Design

The PCB was created in **Altium Designer**, and it supports:
- Soldering MOSFETs in either **TO-220** or **D2PAK** packages.
- Easy replacement of LCL filter components regardless of their **footprint**.

## üîß Technologies Used

- Altium Designer (PCB Design)
- ESP32 (PWM Control)
- IR2104 (MOSFET Drivers)
- STP40NF10L (MOSFETs)
- LCL Filter

## ‚úÖ Summary

This project improved my skills in designing **power electronics hardware** at both the schematic and PCB levels. It also taught me how to implement **universal and flexible design solutions** when working with power systems.
